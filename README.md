# OMIKUJI

This repository was created to make it easy to do fortune telling anywhere.

## Image or Gif

* "Omikuji" is generally used in Japan since ancient times to tell the fortune of an individual or good fortune.

* In order of good fortune, they are arranged in the order od　大吉・吉・中吉・小吉・末吉・凶・大凶

## Outline

* It uses seven types of lotteries that actually exist.

* A sense of realism is created by deliberately leaving a gap of one second.

## Execution
